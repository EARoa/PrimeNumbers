# PrimeNumbers
==============
***Tasks for this assignment***

<p>
Your assignment is to create an app which will detect if the number is prime or not. Use the TDD techniques discussed in the class to write unit tests for your application. You should test the logic of the application and also the controller behavior of the application. Your app will have one UITextField and a UIButton. The user will enter the number in the UITextField and after the button is clicked a UILabel will be updated indicating if the number is prime or not.

The app will also have the following features:

<li>Only numbers are allowed in the UITextField</li>
<li>No decimal numbers are allowed</li>
<li>No alphabets or special characters are allowed</li>
<li>The UITextField cannot be left empty.</li>
<li>All validation errors must be displayed in a UILabel saying "Invalid Input".</li>
<li>Only numbers from 0 to 100 are allowed</li>


Create a class called Prime which will have a function isNumberPrime. The function isNumberPrime will return whether the number is prime or not.
